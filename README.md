# Quickstart

1. review the variables in variables.tf and decide which ones you're going to override.
2. Copy a chef delivery license file into this directory and name it `delivery.license`
3. run `terraform plan` to see what it will do
4. run `terraform apply` to build the infrastructure
5. run `terraform destroy` to tear everything down
